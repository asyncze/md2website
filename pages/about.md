I build software products (full-stack product engineer?). I want to learn more about building programming language tools and compilers. I'm interested in computational intelligence. I used to build financial models and invest in property.

I have a MSc degree in Advanced Computing from King's College London and have taken a few postgraduate courses in corporate finance/ financial research at The Open University Business School (distance learning is very nice).

I have a list with courses taken here: [/courses](/courses.html)

## My stack

I work on a Macbook Pro (16 inch, Intel), wear Sony's noise cancelling headphones, and look at Samsungs's 34 inch ultra wide monitor.

I write code in Python, Ruby, Rust, and C++ (with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as needed). I deploy with AWS (ECB, Lambda, Amplify) and Render. I use Sublime Text for everything.

I type on Apple's Magic keyboard (with numpad) and move pointer with an Xtrfy ultra light mouse.
