# About

I build software products (full-stack product engineer?). I want to build programming language tools and compilers (transitioning). I'm interested in computational intelligence. I used to build financial models and invest in property.

I have a MSc degree in Advanced Computing from King's College London and have taken a few postgraduate courses in corporate finance/ financial research at The Open University Business School (distance learning is very nice). I have a full list of courses taken here: <a href="courses.html">/courses</a>
