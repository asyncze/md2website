# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Michael

I write about programming, projects, and sometimes finance.

I try to maintain a technical [/journal](/journal.html). Check [/notes](/notes.html) for bite-sized code saved mostly for my own reference.

This website was built using one of my [projects](/work.html). It's also available here: [github.com/mrsjoberg/md2website](https://github.com/mrsjoberg/md2website)
