**Now: Building [Stockstack](https://trystockstack.com) and [Hackerman.AI](https://hackerman.ai)**

I build web applications. I am interested in programming languages and compilers, computational intelligence, equity research and finance in general, and most computing-related topics in science. I speak Swedish, Norwegian, and English.

I have a MSc degree in advanced computing from King's College London (2020) and BSc degree in computing and information technology from The Open University (2018). I have completed postgraduate studies in corporate finance and financial research at The Open University Business School (2021).
